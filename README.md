## Restaurants Reviews Team Project

_Tools: Java, Android libraries, Zomato API, Google Maps API_

Description:

1. The Android app that allows users:
    * to search for nearby restaurants, 
    * to save favourites, 
    * to calculate tips, 
    * to add new restaurants manually, from location on the map or by searching by longitude/latitude.
2. The app has the About page, the Settings page to change the user's credentials, and the Login page to login or register a new user.
3. The app allows to sync to the back-end (PHP Laravel website).
4. A part of the joint PHP and Android project, where the Android app communicates with the PHP side using REST API. For the PHP website see: https://github.com/lynnsh/resto-reviews-php
