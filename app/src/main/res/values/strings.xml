        This app allows you to search a database for popular restaurants.
        You can specify a genre, specify a city (where the nearest restaurants within 50km of that location will be shown),
        or you can search for a restaurant by name. This app also allows you to ADD a new restaurant to the database.
        Furthermore, we even provide you with a tip calculator that you can use to find out how much of a tip you should give your waiter following
        your visit.
